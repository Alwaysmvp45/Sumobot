# Sumobot
Code for Sumobot competition
The code here is used to run the sumobot for the MSOE competition
The robot uses a combination of analog reflectance sensors (https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/johnsontimoj/ee2931W16/files2931/QTR-1A.pdf) 
as well as IR transmitter and receiver pairs (https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/johnsontimoj/ee2931W16/files2931/IRInfoSheet.pdf, https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/johnsontimoj/ee2931W16/files2931/PNA4601M.pdf) to stay within a 3' diameter black circle, with white surrounding
For rules about the competition see here: https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/johnsontimoj/ee2931W16/files2931/sumobotRulesMSOE.pdf
The following code is my first run through and is still actively in development so pardon the lack of obvious structure
